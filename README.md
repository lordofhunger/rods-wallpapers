# Wallpapers

In this directory you can find some wallpapers I have collected over the years,
some of which I've used myself, others I just thought were neat but not for me.

Wallpapers are mainly Chainsaw Man, Tengoku Daimakyou/Heavenly Delusion, with some
others as well on the side.

If you are one of the artists or know one of them, feel free to send me a message
to ask for credit, as these are mainly wallpapers I have had lying around for a
very long while.
