# 🖼️ rods-wallpapers

A curated collection of wallpapers — mostly anime, mostly moody, always atmospheric.  
Gathered from forums, archives, screenshots, and friends. Some were used in rices, others were not.

> Featuring: *Chainsaw Man*, *Tengoku Daimakyou*, liminal spaces, schematics, programming aesthetics, and more.

### 🗂️ Folder Layout

All wallpapers live in `wallpapers/`, grouped thematically and numbered for structure.  
Each folder contains a local `README.md` for previews and description.

There are **252 wallpapers** across **27 folders** — and growing.

- `00–09`: Anime and fandom-specific  
- `10–19`: Digital/technical art & design  
- `20–29`: Real-world photography or vibe  
- `30–39`: Colour-based, stylistic, abstract  
- `40–49`: Feeling-driven, eerie, comforting, empty

### ⚠️ Attribution

I don’t own most of the artworks. If you’re the artist (or know them), feel free to reach out and I will gladly credit or remove it.  
Some were found on old drives and their origins are lost to time.
