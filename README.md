# 🎴 Aesthetic Wallpapers Collection

Personal collection of wallpapers gathered over the years — some I've used in my rices, others I just found neat. Mostly anime-inspired, with an emphasis on darker, emotional, or atmospheric styles.

> 🌌 Featuring **Chainsaw Man**, **Tengoku Daimakyou / Heavenly Delusion**, and more.
